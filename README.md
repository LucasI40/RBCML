# Contextualizing
This fork proceeds with the work done by [Victor Netto](https://github.com/VictorNetto) in [PFC](https://github.com/VictorNetto/PFC). It intents to generalize the application by providing users flexibility to create roles and define their limitations. It also aims to add new features like a database, to store roles and users, and authentication, to securely identify who is accessing the application.
